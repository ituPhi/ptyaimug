# **Panama AIMUG — AI Middleware User Group 🇵🇦**

Welcome to the official repository for the **Panama AI Middleware User Group (AIMUG)** — a community of developers, builders, founders, designers, and AI-curious professionals who want to explore the emerging world of **AI middleware**.

Whether you're deep into LangChain/LangGraph, integrating LLMs into production, experimenting with agent frameworks, or you're just curious about how this "middleware" layer is changing software architecture…
**you’re in the right place.**

## 🚀 **What Is AIMUG?**

Panama AIMUG is a community-driven initiative focused on:

* **AI Middleware**: frameworks, orchestration layers, agent systems, RAG, graph-based pipelines, LLM tooling.
* **Practical learning**: short talks, demos, code walkthroughs, project show-and-tells.
* **Local collaboration**: connecting Panamanian developers, companies, and creators.
* **Open discussion**: from production architectures to philosophical implications.

Our mission is simple:
**Help Panama become a regional hub for AI engineering by empowering the people building the future.**

## 📅 **Meeting Structure**

Our sessions are designed to mix learning, inspiration, and connection. A typical meeting runs like this:

```
6:00 – 6:20 — Networking  
6:20 – 6:35 — Welcome & Introduction  
6:35 – 6:50 — Introduction to AI Middleware  
6:50 – 7:00 — AI Middleware News  
7:00 – 7:45 — Lightning Talks (3 slots)  
7:45 – 8:00 — Closing Networking + Off-site transition
```

For the detailed meeting agenda, see:
**[`/meeting-structure.md`](./meeting-structure.md)**

## 🎤 **Lightning Talks**

Lightning talks are 10–15 minute sessions where anyone can share:

* A tool or framework they love
* A personal AI project
* A demo of something they’re building
* A lesson learned from shipping AI in production

If you want to present, open an issue or reach out to a host.

## 🧱 **Why AI Middleware?**

AI is moving fast — but **middleware** is where serious engineering happens:

* Routing, orchestration & agent frameworks
* RAG pipelines, embeddings, vector search
* Model selection + evaluation
* Graph-powered knowledge systems
* Production-grade LLM integration patterns

This is the layer where products become possible.
This is the layer where developers get superpowers.

## 👥 **Who Runs AIMUG?**

The group is organized by:

* **Juan Iturbe** — AI Developer, Agent Systems & Graph Architect
* **Paul [Last Name or Link]** — [Your role/description]

We’re building this community from scratch, so if you want to help, collaborate, or sponsor… **we’re open to it!**

## 🌐 **Join the Community**

More channels are coming soon — for now, stay tuned as we grow the group and publish updates.

---

## 🙌 **Contributing**

This repo will host:

* Meeting agendas
* Slides and talk notes
* Useful resources
* Community contributions
* Examples and demos from members

Feel free to open issues, propose talks, or share your projects.

## 💡 **Our Vision**

Panama can become a Latin American hub for AI engineering — not just consumers of AI tools, but **builders**.

AIMUG is a small but powerful step toward that future.

**Thanks for being part of the start.**

If you want, I can also generate:

* a logo
* a simple brand identity for the group
* a website/landing page in Astro or Next.js
* a Notion page version of the README
* a flyer for the first meetup

Just say the word.
